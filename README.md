# Ames Housing Data

This project aims to build (penalized) linear regression models on the Ames Iowa housing data set. 
A detailed description of the features in this data set is avaialbe at http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt
I built this as the second project for the General Assembly Data Science Immersive bootcamp.

#### Files:
* EDA.ipynb - My initial exploration of the data set.
* BaseModel.ipynb - A linear regression with a small feature set
* data_wrangling.ipynb - An extensive data cleaning, exploration, and some feature engineering of the dataset.
* lr_model.ipynb - Fits linear regression, ridge, and elastic net models to the dataset.
* knn_model.ipynb - Fits k-neighbors regressor to the data, does not perform very well.
* presentation_model.ipynb - Simplified linear regression model with fewer features.
* presentation_visualizations.ipynb - Bar plots and scatter plots used in slide deck
* Presentation Slides.pdf - Presentation slides

#### Folders:
datasets/ - Input files, cleaned data sets, and model residuals
presentation plots/ - All plots used in presentation
submission/ - Prediction files submitted on kaggle
